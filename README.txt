The program does a series of set operations on two sets inputed on the command line.

It does what is required, but the actual code is a bit of a mess. When I have time
I'm going to split the code into a header file and a function file to go with
main.cpp. 

I also should have made the functions more general, and I ended up re-writing
a lot of functionality.
